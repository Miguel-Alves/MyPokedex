# MyPokedex
This application was created in order to develop my skills as a React Native Developer. It consumes an API with information about Pokemons and their world.
The first two screens were based on this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Sj1JuLgfekcY3I2WeimUyl/Desafio-t%C3%A9cnico-front-end-mobile?node-id=314%3A3) prototype.
But My intentions are to develop this to a final complete app providing great information about Pokemon World.

I started this porject with a combination of good timing. While I already had the will to develop a Pokedex, I've been asked to do it as a demonstrarion of knowledfe for o hiring process. 

It has been a great and fun project until now and I learned a lot having such a good desgin prototype to follow. 
I changed some sizes in order for this app perform well in any kind of phone, making it responsive.
